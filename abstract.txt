Music instructors at St. Olaf College have studios with as many as 34 students, all of which need to be scheduled for weekly lessons each new semester. This process is done by hand, which is arduous and time-consuming, and is often revised several times in the first few weeks of term as students’ conflicts are altered. This poster describes a program that streamlines this tedious process. It uses current information on students’ schedules, lesson preferences, and lesson lengths to rapidly create and display viable lesson schedules in order of average student preference for their assigned lesson time. While a sequential program can accomplish this for a small studio size, parallel computing strategies and logical assumptions about the structure of a viable, preferable schedule are necessary to reduce the time and computing resources required for a large-scale problem to reasonable levels. While the original process for creating studio lesson schedules could take many hours and only generated one viable schedule, this program reduces the computation time to within a few minutes and gives multiple viable schedules. This tool allows instructors to better use their time, and students to receive their lesson assignments earlier, allowing them to better plan their semester schedules. The program is also more likely than the original process to create a more preferable final schedule for both instructors and students.
